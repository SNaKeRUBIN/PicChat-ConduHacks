# PicChat
Purpose and Inspiration:

Collecting correctly labelled data has always been a key to successful machine learning research. This project aims to encourage the public participation in providing well labelled data for future machine learning studies.This is achieved through a friendly UI, a widely accepted platform(facebook) and powerful ML API(IBM Watson). By demonstrating the effect of ML through friendly chatting with a bot, user is able to see the benefit of ML but also help the bot grow by providing correct label of custom uploaded images.
