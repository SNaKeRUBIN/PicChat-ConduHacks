My first real boyfriend, Alan, was a year older. We dated the summer after I graduated from high school. Off to college soon, leaving our small town and him, but he asked me to meet his family anyway. He picked me up in his ’79 silver Trans Am and we drove windows down, blasting Bad Company.

An hour later, we arrived at a small blue trailer with a wooden porch. Everyone sat crammed in lawn chairs drinking beer in cozies. After introductions, his mother said, “Ain’t she pretty,” looking me over, nodding her head. “Ain’t she pretty,” they all agreed.
